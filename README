iptables_timely_block_rule
==========================

Block access to tcp communications for all but ten minutes in every hour.



pre-installation
================

*) this script needs dansguardian and tinyproxy to be installed. the script
works by using a transparent proxy to redirect all tcp traffic to dansguardian.
by using dansguardian you can whitelist sites to be never be blocked, or...
whatever.

*) follow these instructions to setup dansguardian (ignoring the setup firefox 
instructions):
http://tinyapps.org/docs/ubuntu_whitelist_blacklist_websites.html

*) the script also makes use of 'logger' to log its activity to the system log
(probably /var/log/syslog), if your system uses something else edit the script
appropriately.



installation
============

*) first copy the script and setup appropriate permissions:

    sudo cp -v iptables_timely_block_rule /root/
    sudo chown -v root:root /root/iptables_timely_block_rule
    sudo chmod -v 0744 /root/iptables_timely_block_rule



*) add two cron jobs, the first to unblock internet access,
and the second to block it. (the command below opens up an
editor in which you type the two lines that follow it).

    sudo crontab -e
    49 * * * * /root/iptables_timely_block_rule unblock
    59 * * * * /root/iptables_timely_block_rule block



*) add the script to startup on boot, by editing /etc/rc.local
and putting the path to the script before 'exit 0', ie:
    sudoedit /etc/rc.local
...
    # By default this script does nothing.

    /root/iptables_timely_block_rule checktime

    exit 0



*) note if your distro does not use sysvinit anymore, it's probably
   using systemd, in which case you'll have to find out how to start
   the script at boot using systemd (I currently am without a systemd
   based distro due to hdd failure).



*) all done, enjoy distraction free computing :-)

*) should you need to unblock net access:
    sudo /root/iptables_timely_block_rule unblock
