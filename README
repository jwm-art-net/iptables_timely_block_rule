iptables_timely_block_rule
==========================

A script to increase productivity by blocking internet/tcp access/traffic
for 50 minutes in every hour.

The script is run by crontab, and also after boot (currently only if
using system V init scripts) to check the time and block accordingly.

NOTE: earlier versions of this script had IPtables redirect traffic
to dansguardian, but due to issues around https traffic and filtering,
as well as the additional configuration required, I decided to make
life easier for myself by merely getting IPtables to drop the traffic
instead.


installation
============

git clone https://github.com/jwm-art-net/iptables_timely_block_rule.git
cd iptables_timely_block_rule

open up the 'install' file and check the contents at the top in the
options section, pay attention to the notes about sysVinit and systemd
and then:

sudo ./install

You might find that you no longer have internet access on your machine.
If you weren't quite ready for this then:
    (and unless you changed INSTPATH).

sudo /root/iptables_timely_block_rule unblock

*) enjoy internet-distraction free computing :-)

*) note: if your distro does not use sysvinit anymore, it's probably
using systemd, in which case /etc/rc.local won't exist and you'll have
to find out how to start the script at boot using systemd (I currently
am without a systemd based distro due to hdd failure).
